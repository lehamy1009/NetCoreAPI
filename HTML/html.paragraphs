<p>Tấm cám</p>
<p>Tam and Cam are two stepsisters, living with their stepmother after their father passed away. Their stepmother was not kind, favored Cam and abused Tam. One day, she sent them fishing and promised to give a red bib to whoever caught more. Tam skillfully caught fish and quickly filled the basket, while Cam struggled.
    </p>   
<p>Feeling jealous, Cam stole Tam’s fish. Heartbroken, Tam cried and a god advised her to take care of the remaining fish. The plate nourishes it, forming a bond. Cam and his mother suspected Tam’s actions so they plotted to kill the fish. Tam was saddened by its death and cried. The Buddha advised her to bury the fish bones under the bed. The Buddha transformed into a gorgeous dress and a magical chariot, escorting Tam to a festival where she lost her shoe. The king was intrigued by the shoe and went to find its owner.

    The sheet fits perfectly and becomes the queen. On the anniversary of his father’s death, Cam and his mother tricked Tam, causing him to die. Tam turned into a golden bird, then a peach tree, and finally turned into a magical fruit, becoming the daughter of a nobleman. When the king met Tam again, he recognized her by the betel she prepared. They reunited, punished Cam and her mother, and lived happily ever after.
